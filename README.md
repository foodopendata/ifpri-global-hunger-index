The [Global Hunger Index](http://ifpri.org) (GHI) is a multidimensional statistical tool used to describe the state of the hunger situation around the world. The GHI measures progress and failures in the global fight against hunger.

> Each year, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) calculates GHI scores in order to assess progress, or the lack thereof, in decreasing hunger. The GHI is designed to raise awareness and understanding of regional and country differences in the struggle against hunger. By calling attention to the issue, we hope that this report will help to increase the commitment and resources dedicated to ending hunger worldwide.
